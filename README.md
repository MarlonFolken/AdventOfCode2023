# Solving AdventOfCode2023 with a UI (user interface)

Solving challenges within [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

My aproach has a twist by using:
- Typescript
- User Interface beyond just characters
- Handling interaction with React
- Mounted with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Mounting project
After cloning this repository and heading inside of `adventofcode2023` folder in the Terminal, 
run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
